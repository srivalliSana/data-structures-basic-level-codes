# data-structures-basic-level-codes
 a set of fundamental data structure implementations written in C programming language. Here, we aim to provide beginners and enthusiasts alike with a solid foundation in essential data structure concepts.

The implementations covered here include:

Array
Stacks
Queues
Circular Queues
Linked Lists
Doubly Linked Lists
Binary Trees
Binary Search Trees
sorting algorithms tooo
For each of these modules, there exist corresponding headers and source files. Additionally, unit tests have been included in their respective directories to verify correctness. Each module's README explains its functionality further.

Compiling instructions:

Download or clone the repository to your computer.
Change into the directory relating to the specific data structure you intend to explore.
Utilize a C compiler, e.g., GNU C Compiler (GCC), to compile the sources contained within.
Execute the compiled binary.
Should you choose to contribute to this project, kindly do so by submitting a pull request following careful examination of current code quality standards. We welcome all proposals and enhancements!

Enjoy exploring the fascinating realm of data structures in C!
